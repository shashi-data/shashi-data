Hi there, 👋
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm Shashi. I help e-commerce start-ups expand by harnessing the power of data. In my tech career of 14 years, I have worked with numerous small and big SW and Engineering teams and have created tons of Data Science and Machine Learning Solutions. 

__My learning so far:__ The hardest thing about Machine Learning is NOT about training models or the math behind the algorithms, but be able to frame a business problem as a machine learning solution. Every company have different challenges and they need solutions tailored to their needs. Reach out to me on:
